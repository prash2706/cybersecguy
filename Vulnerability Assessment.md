**Risk Assessment & vulnerability Evaluation**

**Description**

I am performing a risk assessment by evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly threaten business operations. Then, I will decide how to prioritize company's resources based on the risk scores you assign each vulnerability.

**Scenario**
I've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

My supervisor is asking me to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, I will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, I will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, I will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. I will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.

**Risk Register**

**Operational Environment:**
The bank is situated in a coastal area with low crime rates. Numerous individuals and systems manage the bank's data, including 100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank comprises 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are promoted by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. Strict financial regulations mandate the bank to secure its data and funds, such as ensuring sufficient cash is available daily to meet Federal Reserve requirements.

Asset: The asset at risk of being harmed, damaged, or stolen.
Risk(s): A potential risk to the organization's information systems and data.
Description: A vulnerability that might lead to a security incident.
Likelihood: Score from 1-3 of the chances of a vulnerability being exploited. A 1 means there's a low likelihood, a 2 means there's a moderate likelihood, and a 3 means there's a high likelihood.
Severity: Score from 1-3 of the potential damage the threat would cause to the business. A 1 means a low severity impact, a 2 is a moderate severity impact, and a 3 is a high severity impact.
Priority: How quickly a risk should be addressed to avoid the potential incident. Use the following formula to calculate the overall score: Likelihood x Impact Severity = Risk

**Notes**
Some risk factors to have considered might have been the number of other companies that interact with the bank. These sources of risk might introduce incidents beyond the bank's control. Also, the risk of theft is important to consider because of the number of customers and the operational impact it could have to the business.

**Likelihood**
A range of likelihood scores were estimated based on factors that could lead to a security incident. Each risk was scored as a 1, 2, or 3 on a risk matrix, meaning the chances of occurring were rare, likely, or certain. A supply chain attack caused by natural disaster was scored with a 1, meaning it was regarded as unlikely due to the unpredictability of those events. On the other hand, compromised data events were scored a 2 because they are likely to occur given the possible causes.

**Severity**
No risk received a severity score less than 2 because risks that involve data breaches such as business email compromise, can have serious consequences. Customers at a bank trust the businesses to protect their money and personal information. Also, the bank's operations could be terminated if they fail to comply with regulations.

**Priority**
A financial records leak received the highest overall risk score of 9. This indicates that this risk is almost certain to happen and would greatly impact the bank's ability to operate. Such a high overall score signals the security team to prioritize remediating, or resolving any issues related to that risk before moving on to risks that scored lower.

**Key takeaways**
Risk assessments are useful for identifying risks to an organizationâ€™s information, networks and systems. Security plans can benefit from regular risk assessments as a way of highlighting important concerns that should be addressed. Additionally, these assessments help keep track of any changes that can occur in an organization's operating environment.
